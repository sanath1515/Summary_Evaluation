The students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that Jones felt it was slipping out of control.  He decided to terminate the movement, so he lied to students by announcing that the Third Wave was a part of a nationwide movement and that on the next day a presidential candidate of the movement would publicly announce its existence on television. instead of a televised address of their leader, the students were presented with a blank channel.

In the pickling of hams they had an ingenious apparatus, by which they saved time and increased the capacity of the plant—a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor—a process known to the workers as “giving them thirty per cent.” Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as “Number Three Grade,” but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron. After this invention there was no longer Number One, Two, and Three Grade—there was only Number One Grade. The packers were always originating such schemes—they had what they called “boneless hams,” which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and “California hams,” which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy “skinned hams,” which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy them—that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled “head cheese!”',\n",

This lead to the ending of the experiment because it had gotten out of control.

Students  were eager to join the Third Wave,  because it made them feel stronger and more important than their peers. This is shown through  the students' willigness to incriminate their peers for not following the rules (paragraph 3).  When the students were given the oppurtunity to feel superior to their peers, they took it without a second thought. The  experiment got out of control so quickly  because of the blind dedication it required from it's participants.

[...] After only three days, the experiment took on a life of its own, with students from all over the school joining in. The class expanded from initial 30 students to 43 attendees\" (CommonLit). This cluster of text qoutes shows how legitamately the student took directions because the students did not even hesitate to follow orders nor did they question the ethics of some of the rules. For example, not a single student questioned the morals of the salute when it was purposefully intended to resemble that of the Nazi regime\\'s salute. This not only proves how naive minor\\'s can be to their superiors but also demonstrates how quickly society can follow one another when the majority is commiting said action. This is the classic case that everyone and their neighboor\\'s mom told you as a kid: \"If your friend jumped off a bridge would you jump too?\"- in this case and many, yes, you would be more likely to commit an action, even if it may be questionable, if your peers are also participating in the action. This fact connects back not only many examples throughout human history but in varying life forms across the globe. Birds for example learn to fly, walk, eat, etc. by watching their siblings and following the mother. It is human nature to follow the pack and unfortunately it is not always a benefit to society.

After Jones showed the student's how much of an authority figure he was and what he could do with that power, he gave it to the students and showed them how to use it by creating a key card for members of the Third Wave.

Another reason why the group grew so big, so quickly because as more people joined others who were not apart of the group felt left out and some were probably peerpressured into joining, this fear of missing out could be the reason that many of the member joined.

Another factor that caused the development of the Third Wave is the assignment of tasks.

This quote showed that the growth may not have started rapidly, but later the text says that the group eventually had 200 members. One of the ways this was possible was that outside of class, students used the salute, intriguing those not involved and eventually allowing more people to join. Most people give in to peer pressure, but when everyone around you is doing something, isn\\'t it hard to not do that same thing as well? The experiment proved this simply with a fake group, and one person starting the wave with a few instructions grew to 200 people following those same instructions.

The Nazis had no real idea what was going on, they just followed orders because that is how they were trained.

In paragraph 3, the text states, \" Jones instructed the students on how to initiate new members, and by the end of the day the movement had over 200 participants.\" This evidence shows how Jones knew that the students would listen and start recruiting others and how they were all following everything Jones said because they feared standing out.

This experiment developed over such a short period of time because that is what happens when the whole crowd is telling people to support or be a certain way. This happens in real life and only takes a short amount of time since so many people are following one thing or idea and it spreads rapidly. The experiment ended because Jones realized first of all that if the experiment went on any longer it would lead to an authoritarian school and result in something much more than a experiment if it went on. He also noticed that it worked out too perfectly probably and that it was time to go ahead and end the experiment since it was a success already. Jones was also not in control of it really anymore since so many students joined and took authority over it. He knew it was time to bring his main lesson across clearly to all the students at the school instead of continuing what he was against and let it get even more out of control.',\n",

The author says \"All of the students were issued a member card and each of them received a special assignment, like designing a Third Wave Banner, stopping non-members from entering the class, or other tasks to bring honor to the movement,\" (CommonLit 3). It is common knowledge that envy and jealousy are present in every human being, and this must be the reason that so many outside students joined. As described in the quote, there were many things within the experiment that were exclusive of outside students. The students out of the experiment must have felt a desire to join in with the other students, an indirect form of peer pressure, if you will. The experiment was ended early due to its rapidly increasing intensity, and the operator of the experiment feared what would become of it were it to continue, thus he ended it. Jones\\' fear is expressed in the quote, \"By the fourth day of the experiment, the students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that Jones felt it was slipping out of control,\" (CommonLit 5).

This experiment was ended after the fifth day, however, because the students were so involved and loyal that the teacher felt that he could no longer control it.

The first thing he did was teach them how to seat and strict classroom discipline.  He put in a salute that was like the nazi salute and he was seeing if the kids show what he was doing. By day three the group got 13 more people. They were all had member cards and they each had their own assignment. On day four they became really into their assignment and they had become really loyal. Jones said it was a movement that would be existence.

The movement\\'s purpose was to eliminate democracy, and one of the central points that Jones provided was that, \" democracy\\'s main weakness is that it favors the individual over the whole community\" ( The Third Wave 1).  Moreover, he encouraged them even more to join by creating a catchy motto that read, \"Strength through discipline, stregth through community, strength throught action, strength through pride\" ( The Third Wave 1). When the students joined the movement, not only they followed every single rule put by Jones, rules such as calling him Mr.Jones for every remark they wanted to make. They had to be sitted and oaying attention before the second bell, had to stand up every time one asked a question with three words or fewer. These were strict rules, rules that they were not used to. Yet, they followed them. Moreover, the experiment ended because Jones got a little worried that these experiment was getting a little out of control. The students were too loyal and their discipline was outstanding. They were taking this movement very seriously. ',\n",

The experiemnt was ended because the students were not showing that people were shwoing off senses of superior over others.

The experiment needed to end because the discipline and turning in other students was becoming out of hand.

As democracy was expelled from the classroom Ron Jones was seem to become more of an authoritarian figure in the classroom as he told the rules and continue to make a very strict résumé for students to be as disciplined as possible. The main concern in this experiment was when he made a slew resembling that of the Nazi regime where students would have to salute to each other even when they were outside his classroom. As the movement gained popularity the new motivated students became a sort of court not letting any nonmembers into the classroom and eventually got over 200 participants. The main reasoning for terminating the movement was because students became too invested into the experiment and Jones felt it was slipping out of his control to get rid of the experiment he lied to the students by announcing that the third wave was a part of a national wave movement and Jones ordered students to attend a publicly announced presidential candidate of the movement, when the day came they were presented with a blank channel and Jones saw that as an opportunity to announce that they were a part of an experiment to demonstrate how people willingly create a sense of superiority over others even when horrible things are happening.',\n",

The kids then were taught how to intiate new members and by the end of the day the group grew to 200 participants. The experiment was ended because the kids were too loyal.

Mr. Jones started off on simple terms which, over a little bit of time, grasped the students' minds. It helped them feel like part of a group, and that is a good feeling to hold, especially to teenagers. So when Mr. Jones amped it up a bit by giving them certain privliges it kept blinding them from it even though it seemed sketchy. They didn't question and if someone did the other kids wouldn't listen and instead report them. The students were so blind that they didn't even realise they were performing something close to the Nazi soldier symbol. The kids were also not just doing it blindly. At the beginning of the experient he conditioned them to think of him as an authoritive figure and they if they didnt listen they would be disiplined. Just like the Nazis, if they didnt do what Hitler wanted them to do, well they could just die or go to jail. So that shows that some might have been forced into it. Mr. jones ended the experiment to show the kids how far they went and to teach them how easily it was to be sucked in, because they all just were. This goes to show how dangerous it can be to follow a crowd, so go out there and be independent.\",\n",

       " 'The Third Wave quickly developed due to it being conducted in a small environment, a school, where within a short time, everyone knew of its existence. Part of this would be due to such actions as required salutes outside of class or special assignments for members. Due to the group\\'s apparent exclusivity, the appeal to join allowed for quick growth and created a sense of superiority within members. However, due to how quickly the group grew, Jones realized that the experiment was going to fall out of control and thusly \"pulled the plug.\" The main reason for this is likely that if the experiment had continued, students within the Third Wave would spark conflict with those who were not and further demonstrate how feelings of superiority lead to bad outcomes.',\n",

When they all came he told them that they where part of an experiment to demonstrate how people willingly create a sense of superiority over others, and how this can lead people to justify doing horrible things in the name of the state's honor.\",\n",

This gave the attention of a union being created by students that other students wanted to be included in. By initiating more and more students daily that were easily following the rules, the experiment had to be stopped. The Third Wave was just meant to be an experiment for Mr. Jones's class to understand how easy it is to enforce an idea on someone and make them believe and continue to spread it. The experiment obviously worked because it was becoming too big to handle and had to be stopped. By calling an assembly, Jones was easily able to get all the members in one room to understand how easy it was to control them and to spread his power. Now that they understand the experiment's purpose, it had to be stopped before it got any bigger.\",\n",

He Started this experiment called The Third Wave in april of 1967 and it went on for three days and it ended on the fourth because he realized that it was becoming too hard to handle and it was slipping out of his control. He started the experiment because he found it hard to explain what is called herd behavior and how much power a dictator can have alone over so many people. So he then created an authoritative dictatorship in his classroom to teach his students the German’s mentality. He then made many rules to go along with the dictatorship like the students have to stand up while participating in class etc.. The text in paragraph 1 states “History teacher Ron Jones, finding himself unable to explain to his students how people throughout history followed the crowd even when terrible things were happening, decided to demonstrate it to his students through an experiment.” This shows how and why he started the experiment and how it was hard to explain these things to his students. His students had become involved and loyal to the project.',\n",

All of the students were issued a member card and each of them received a special assignment, like designing a Third Wave Banner, stopping non-members from entering the class, or other tasks to bring honor to the movement.\" This system of gaiing members for a \"superior\" group will get more recruits. As everyone follows the other, the group continues to grow until the amount is too large to control. The teacher stopped the expiriment because there were too many followers and too many of them were encouraging people to joining or forcing them by bullying until submission.',\n",
       " 'The third wave gained popularity quickly because  Ron Jones introduced it to his high school class.   There was an appeal to the idea of the third wave as well as an appeal to the motto.  Students wanted to illuminate democracy and also wanted to become stronger from this experience .  By the fifth day it became completely out of control and had to be stopped.',\n",
       " ' Ron developed an authoritative dictatorship in the classroom to teach students the German mentality. He established rules such as students should stand up when asking or answering questions in three words, students saluting each other similar to that of the Nazi at school and even outside of school. On the fourth day, Ron ended the experiment when he realized that it was slipping out of his control. The students had become extremely involved in the project with high discipline and loyalty to the project.',\n",
       " 'The Third Wave developed very quickly because of rules and actions that were seen outside of the classroom. When Mr. Jones\\' started applying rules, it started simply by standing up to ask or answer a question. Soon actions from the experiment were taken outside of the classroom in front of other people. Mr. Jones started to give instructions that had to be followed outside of the class. He transformed the class to be more disciplined and more of a community by,  \"resembling that of the Nazi regime and ordered class members to salute each other even outside the class. They all obeyed this command.\" Other students must have been interested when only a certain amount of them was doing this secret salute. Other students saw this as an opportunity to feel included in the secret salute and everyone started to join.  Once everyone wanted to join the movement got had gotten out of hand. There were over 200 participants that joined. Mr. Jones started to lose control after so many people joined.  The students became so disciplined and loyal to the project the control started slipping away from Jones, and he had to put an end to it.',\n",

However as a few days went by it went from 30 to 200 people in a quick amount of time.  All of these people listened to Jones and did exactly what he said and they weren\\'t exactly thinking much of it.  When he introduced the salute signal non of the students said no to it and they all did it, \"Jones made up a salute resembling that of the Nazi regime and ordered class members to salute each other even outside the class.  They all obeyed this command.\" Clearly they replicated what occured with the Nazis without even knowing they were doing it.  This shows how out of hand the experiemtn got and it could have gotten worse if it was continued.  However Jones thought it was appropriate to end the experiment.  This was because it proved his point of how people willingly create superitority and sometimes without even knowing which could lead to bad things. ',\n",

The experiment took off fairly fast with the students when more people started getting involved with it and reporting to Mr. Ron. He soon had to let the student know it was an experiment when students started thinking more highly of themselves. He soon realized the students had taken this third wave to a certain extent where they thought of themselves  as supirior and other students started joining in. He soon explained that he had to end it because of how people willingly create a sense of supiriority over others. ',\n",
       " 'The Third Wave developed and grew over such a short time because of the sense of strength and superiority  it gave the students. The students believed that this high level of discipline made them appear supreme to other students. Eventually other students joined in \"The Third Wave\" to also feel this sense of superiority. He ended it because it got out of control and students were becoming too involved and absorbed into the experiment.',\n",

It started out by implementing simple but strict rules in the classroom. By the end of the first week, students liked being part of an exclusive group. Jones, the teacher and leader of the experiment, added a hand gesture, similar to the Nazi solute, and advised the students to greet each other with the geture, even outside of class (Paragraph 2). The experiment grew, with more and more participants, with the students' disipline growing as well. Jones ended the experiment because it was getting out of control. He told all the students that he had been trying to teach them how easily they could be pursuaded into joining a group that promoted higher status. The experiment worked because often, when people join a group, it is because they want power and believe that they are superior to others.\",\n",

As once student began changing their actions and behaviors, all other students quickly joined.  When the fourth day of the experiment came along, Jones felt as if he was loosing control of his students. This was because their involvement in the experiment was increasing and their loyalty, as well as discipline was becoming too much.

But as the week progressed, the students started taking the project very seriously (in a bad way). Eventually, Jones felt the experiment slipping out of his control so he told his students that the president of the Third Wave was going to speak on televison. When the speech never happened, Jones told his students that the whole thing was an experiement that he created.',\n",

The students were reporting to Mr. Jones without being asked to do so and were eager to help with any Third Wave related tasks. They improved academically and disciplinarily to please Mr. Jones. They initiated new members and eventually increased their numbers to over 200.  Mr. Jones did not anticipate that the movement would go as far as it did, so he had to terminate it to avoid it from spiraling out of control.',\n",

For instance, \"By the fourth day of the experiment, the students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that Jones felt it was slipping out of control\" (4).

Another way the factory would \"give them thirty per cent\", which was using 2 rounds of a pickling to destroy what was described as \"an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them.\" (Sinclair 2). One way they used odd sources for their \\'meat\\' was by extracting bone. Another odd source was the knuckles, joints, and all meat. The author states, \"The packers were always originating such schemes- they had what they called \"boneless hams\", which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and \"California hams\", which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out.\" (Sinclair 2).',\n",

One such quote  in the Jungle states, \"the whole ham was spoiled... cut up by the two thousand revolution... and mixed with half a ton of other meat,\".

To make the meat look fresh, they would \"call upon their chemistry department, and preserve it with borax and color it with gelation to make it brown.\" (Sinclair 5).

Another method they used was to inject a ton of pickles into the spoiled meat to remove the odor. From the book, it states, ¨ pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor\" (Paragraph 2).  Due to this, they hid the spoiled meat not just in bits, but in plain sight. ',\n",

Not only are the factories willing to do this but the employees aswell.  Looking at this question of whether or not to use supplies to contaminate meat seems like a very simple answer. However, to the factory workers in the twentieth century, it was not. Not only was it not a simple answer there was no question.  \"There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it ... . It was too dark in these storage places to see well ... There was no place for the men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner\" (4-5) Sinclair goes on to explain that there was not an option for the workers, and the factory owners knew this.  They knew the workers needed the money to provide for their families.  To add to the atmosphere of the factories Sinclair says, \"With one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a sausage factory, the family had a first-hand knowledge\" (1) The people were scared to step up for fear of backlash from their \"family\".

Additionally, other conditions were that, \"...there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them\"(Sinclair 2). To cover this issue up, they would rub sode on the meat to try to deordorize it. Yet, that not working shows how gross the meat really was. The workers did not wash their hands- they did not even have the ability to do so, and they spit all over the food. There was absolutely no sense of sterilization as, \"...making a practice of washing them in the water that was to be ladled into the sausage. There were the butt-ends of smoked meat, and the scraps of corned beef, and all the odds and ends of the waste of the plants, that would be dumped into old barrels in the cellar and left there\" (Sinclair 5). To cover this up, they would trick their consumers and re-color the meat with broax and gelatin to make it look a presentable color.

In addition, when hams that were pickled were found spoiled, some of them with, \"...an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them,\" (Sinclair), a second pickle would instead be pumped into the same meat, which destroyed the odor. This process, so often used in the meatpacking industry, became known to the workers as \"giving them thirty per cent\" (Sinclair). Lastly,  the industry would relabel products after working on the meat to make the odor, bacteria, or old parts of the meat go away, creating products such as \"boneless hams\", which were \"odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings,\" or even \"skinned hams,\" labeled as fancy, which were made of the oldest pigs, with heavy and coarse skin, \"...that no one would buy-that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled \"head cheese!\"\" (Sinclair).

It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats.\" The explanation regarding the rats and the leaky rooms emphasizes the feeble conditions located in the specific offices.

The next method was used when the whole ham was spolied, \"mixed with half a ton of other meat, no odor that ever was in a ham could make any difference.\" The last heinous method was put in place when sausage came over from euope moldy and white, they would resell it once chemicals were used to make it avalible for consumption, \"it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.\"',\n",

From the text it\\'s shown that the workers would use baking soda to take away the strong odor of the sour meat, and even used chemistry to give it a more fresh taste and odor. This method saved the company money, but was wrong because it was selling people spoiled meat that could possibly make them sick. In paragraph 2 it also states, \"... some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle with destroyed the odor--a process known to the workers as \\'giving them thirty percent\\'\" (Sinclair par.2). When the stench from the meat was bad enought workers would also use a machine to fill the meat with pickle to help rid of the odors. They would use much stronger pickle, and still end up selling the spoiled meat. In the end, the ways they would cover up the spoiled meat is by using baking soda, pickle, or chemistry to help rid of the odors to sell spoiled meat to consumers. ',\n",
       " 'Some of the ways factories would use spoiled meat is by: mixing it with other meat and turning it into sausage or even using soda to \"conceal\" the rotting smell of it. In the first paragraph Sinclair talks about how his superior would encourage workers to do so in order to make the most out of the meat. In the second paragraph, in the begining, the process in which stinky, rotten meat would be covered up started with being rubbed with soda. ',\n",
       " 'There was various ways the factory would use and cover up spoiled meat. One way the factory did this in the beginning was by chopping it up and making it into sausage. In the text it says the meat couldn\\'t be used for anything else so sausage was their last resort. Another way they covered up spoiled meat was by using chemicals. In the text it says \"Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of picle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose.\" This goes to show chemicals played a role in the process, but not only did they make it into sausage and use chemicals, they also would pump the meat. Over time the factory gained control over a second pickle one much stronger than the first and this one got rid of the odor of the meat completely making the price rise thiry cents because the meat didn\\'t smell. Although the meat was already contaminated and spoiled enough, they even furthered and used the skin of the oldest hogs. This skin wasn\\'t very appealing to the eye or probably the sense of touch so they would chop it up into finer pieces and call it \"head cheese\". The last process of the factory occured when the meat was completely spoiled mold and all. The text says \"it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.\". This is the last way the factory covered up their spoiled meat.

       " 'The factory had done a system called pickling hams, which was supposed to preserve them, yet, they were found to be spoiled. One way they would have taken the odor off was to rub it with soda to take the smell away (paragraph 2).  Another one is that if the spoiled meat that has been pickled or gone bad, then they have the bad part cut out and turned into \"boneless ham\" (paragraph 2).  These were then sold and eaten on free lunch counters. Furthermore,  when the whole meat was bad the meat factories would chop it up with other meat and then add in borax and glycerin into the hoppers to cover up spoiled meat (paragraph  3).  The meat was never taken care of properly and they were disgusting, which led them to use or cover up spoiled meat.',\n",

Another form of covering up rotten meat would be taking out the bone where the rotten part was found and inserting a white-hot iron. this would erase the visible trace of rotten and or spoiled meat.

To save time and increase their capacity, they used a machine that would be able to pickle a ham in a few seconds, but would sometimes leave the hams spoiled with a disgusting odor. To solve this issue, the packers used a stronger pickle. After smoking the hams, some would be found to have gone bad but were still sold to the public as \"Number Three Grade\".

As a result of rats running around, they poison them. After poisoning the rats, the rats would go in the hopper with the meat while they are processing. Workers call the poisoned rat a tidbit, and they did not care to remove the rat from the meat. This was extremely unsanitary and cruel. According to the text, it states, \"There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms, and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it.\" Workers were also capable of changing the meat into; however, they wanted them, such as turning the meat brown or making the meat \"unspoil.\" They would use chemistry and machines to change spoiled meat. If it were so difficult to get these meats to change, they would sell it as a number three grade meat. According to the text, it states, \"Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as \"Number Three Grade,\" but later on, some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron.\" The workers also rubbed meat in soda to get meat to go from sour to sweet and change the bad odor. After doing this, they would provide it to people over the free lunch counter. These conditions were very harsh, but workers did not care about deceiving the public; they only wanted money. ',\n",
       " 'The text specifically states, \"they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell\" (Sinclair, 2). The evidence explains how the workers would cover up the foul smell of the spoiled meat. Also, the text states, \" there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them.\" indicating that the meats would carry a foul odor on them once they spoiled.  Although, the workers knew that the meat was spoiled, they would still sell it to the public. For example the text says, \"Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as “Number Three Grade,”.

       " 'Upton Sinclair strengthens his argument that conditions were unsanitary in meat processing factories through describing the various ways in which workers would use or cover up spoiled meat. This included suppressing the odor through the use of borax and glycerin, adding more meat to cover the spoiled meat, filling hams with pickle, chopping spoiled meat to make \"sausage\", selling bad hams as \"Number Three Grade\", and through extracting the bone of bad ham and selling it as boneless ham. Since spoiled meat had a very strong odor to it, workers within factories had to ensure that consumers would not be able to smell it so that they would be more likely to buy and consume it. As a result, they used sweet smelling or odorless products in order to mask the stench. Hams were pickled with a machine that was both quick and effective, but would sometimes spoil the meat further. This detail further helped to support Sinclair\\'s claim that factories mainly cared about making a profit rather than the health of their consumers. Additionally, factory workers used methods of hiding or covering up spoiled meat by making it more subtle through covering it with unspoiled meat or chopping it into smaller pieaces so it would go unnoticed by consumers. Lastly, Sinclair describes how spoiled ham was especially covered up through selling bad ham as \"Number Three Grade\" or \"smoked ham\". Later however, \"they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron\" (Sinclair 1906). This would eliminate the title of \"Number Three Grade\" in favor of \"boneless ham\".',\n",

This quote from the article explains to us how they covered up the molded meat by using strong and toxic chemicals to get rid of the smell and turn the meat back to brown. The factories had no health regulations, the meat was stored in places infested with germs. The factories knew how filthy their facility was and had put no effort in  to change it. In paragraph 4 it states, “There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs.”(4). This tells us how nobody cared about the condition the meat was in and how no one enforced them to follow any guidelines that had been put in place. Workers knew that what they were doing was wrong and never second guessed it, “a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together.”(4). This quote from the article tells the reader how they used rat meat for sausages. These rats contained many diseases and carried poison from eating contaminated  bread.

The meat industry used soda to mask the smell and sold the meat on open counters causing more disease. Soda could have worn off and the company could have possibly be sued. The industry could have also used pickle juice or some other type of smell. \"To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor,\" ( paragraph 2).

Not knowing what they are inserting they would still place the hot rod in the meat to make it seem like nothing was wrong with it. There were other things they did to cover up that the meat was spoiled but still be able to sell it to make a profit and even though all of these techniques were different they all had the same job and that was to make spoiled, moldy, and smelly meat look good as new and still sell it to people to make their money, or even to get rid of it.',\n",

Extremely spoiled meat would be mixed with other meat until it was impossible to discern the spoiled meat from the other meats (Paragraph 3). Rotten meat would also be covered in borax and glycerin before being made into sausages and sold (Paragraph 3).

Some other ways included putting meat with dirt and rust from waste barrels and mixing it with fresh meat. \"Every spring they did it; and in the barrels would be dirt and rust and old nails and stale water - and cartload after cartload of it would be taken up and dumped into the hoppers with fresh meat, and sent out to the public\\'s breakfast.\" This shows some of the ways in which the meatpacking industry had hidden spoiled meat from the public.',\n",

These factories would also take out parts of the ham to resell it at top value. Also in the second paragraph, it says \"later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron. After this invention there was no longer Number One, Two, and Three Grade—there was only Number One Grade.\" By making meats boneless these companies and factories would be able to avoid the bad quality labels and would be able to get away with a possibly dangerous health risk.  These factories would grind up meats and animal products that had gone bad in order to support the high demand and save money, despite the potential harm that this process has on customers. This can be supported by a sentence in the third paragraph that says \"Cut up by the two-thousand-revolutions- a-minute flyers, and mixed with half a ton of other meat, no odor that ever was in a ham could make any difference.\" ',\n",

Hence, Upton Sinclair states, \"...there would come all the way back from Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white – it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.\" This confirms another way the factory would use spoiled meat was by taking cleaners such as borax and a moisturizer like glycerin to keep the image that the sausage is clean is juicy even if it\\'s not.

       " 'In the novle \"the jungle\" by Upton Sinclair he describes how the meat packing industery worked with the meat. He went on to describe in detail the horriable unsafe, disgusting, and moraliy wrong prosses that of which the meat was packaged. One thing the industery would do is putting many chemicals into the rotten meat to make it look better so that people would buy it.  As seen in the novel, \"Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell [...] also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose. In the pickling of hams they had an ingenious apparatus, by which they saved time and increased the capacity of the plant—a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. [...]  Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as “Number Three Grade,” but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron.\"(Sinclair 2). This qoute shows how the industery would use jsut about any means to sell the meat they had even if it ment using unsafe means to change it completly. Such as droping loads of rotten meat into tubs of vinager and leaving it so that it would be more appealing.  In \"The Jungle\" it also states, \"Some of it they would make into \"smoked\" sausage – but as the smoking took time, and was therefore expensive, they would call upon their chemistry department, and preserve it with borax and color it with gelatin to make it brown.\" (Sinclair 5). This qoute shows one of the many dangerous chemicals they would put in the meat, as borax is a cleaning tool. Eatting could lead to death as seen in www.medicalnewstoday.com it states, \"Borax is not safe to ingest. According to the NLM\\'s Toxicology Data Network, borax is easy for the body to break down when either inhaled or swallowed. However, if inhalation or ingestion occurs, both serious poisoning and organ damage can result.\"(Wilson 2019). This quote shows how dangerous it is to ingest Borax.',\n",
       " 'Factories would either use spoiled meat or cover up the odor and sell them. According to the passage, the best way to use spoiled meat was \"to can it or else to chop it up into sausage.\" By canning it or putting it in sausage the difference was not as abnormal and they could get away with selling it. However, sometimes the factories would simply cover up the smell and sell spoiled meat as is.  The text states that \"they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell\" which allowed them to get away with selling spoiled meat.',\n",
       " 'In the factories there were many different ways that workers would use spoiled meat including putting it into sausage, putting pickles inside of it, extracting the bone from the inside of the meat, and they would mix the spoiled meat with fresh meat.

They will try to smoke the hams so that the odor will go away. And even though they will do these things the meat will still have germs and it could possibly kill the people who were eating it.

Following the pickling,  \"they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters\". The second method was taking out all of the skin and bones of the livestock where most of the bad parts would generally be, and insert a white-hot iron rod into the hole.  From there, several different \"styles\" of boneless ham were created, including California. Adding on to that,  skinless bones were also created, where the thick skin of old hogs would be relabeled \"head cheese!\"',\n",

For example, they would fill spoiled hams with a pickling filler that covered up the fact that they were spoiled.  In addition, people would collect all of the scraps and spoiled meat on the ground.  They put the dead rats, poisoned bread, and the rat poop into the same cart.  They would dump these carts into barrels.  One time a year they would dump these barrels into the same system with \"fresh\" meat.  In a sense, no matter how spoiled the meat was, they would never throw it away.  All of the spoiled meat was dumped into with new meat.  Spoiled meat was sold just like new meat.',\n",
